# Crypto App
Iwell, I've finished building the Crypto App. But sorry, I didnt cover the unit test because I had limited time. From the 3 days given, I can only use 2 days because on one of the days (Sundays), I have to help my cousin's wedding :') (But, I have worked with unit testing when I was at the previous company, so I have a pretty good grasp.)

I think thats enough for the intro.

### I build the Crypto App using multiple dependencies with dependency manager **"Cocoapods"**

**1. Alamofire** - To handle request, response, and error network for connect the app to [min-api.cryptocompare.com](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/documentation?key=Toplists&cat=topTotalTopTierVolumeEndpointFull)

**2. SwiftyJSON** -  to handle JSON Response from request network.

**3. RXSwift & RXCocoa** - to handle data binding, asynchronously task, and reactive programming on the Crypto App that I build using MVVM Architecture.

**4. Starscream** - to make the Crypto App working with websocket (well, this is my first experience working with websocket, and its fun :D)

The UI on the Cryptho app, I build using storyboard auto-layout, and add some code to improve scrolling performance.

_After All, I thank you very much, and hope that this can be a consideration for me to work as an iOS Developer at Bibit.id_
